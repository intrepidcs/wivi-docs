Open Vehicle Spy 3 on a PC. (Connection to hardware is not needed) 2. Click Measurement and open VehicleScape DAQ. (Figure 1) 3. Setup a platform with databases. 4. Select Channels of messages and signals to log. 5. Configure Standalone Logging options. 6. Generate the VS3ZIP script on your PC.  Figure: Opening VehicleScape DAQ  Figure: Use Vehicle Spy 3 VehicleScape DAQ to make a VS3ZIP script for supported neoVI Connect/RED2/FIRE3 hardware.  VehicleScape DAQ: Database/Hardware Setup Tab (Setup Databases)  The critical role of the Database/Hardware Setup tab (Figure 1) is to set up databases for decoding all vehicle network data. You can also use this tab to change the VS3ZIP script file name and set up neoVI Connect/RED2/FIRE3 hardware.  Setup Databases  The Platform Setup section has four parts. All database choices made here will affect the list of signals available on the Channels tab nearby.    The first section is the Current Platform.  The platform consists of the entire group of databases in the next three sections. VehicleScape is very database-dependent, so selecting the correct platform is important! If the platform is not correct or does not exist yet, this section will let you correct it. To change the platforms in the list, click the Setup Platforms button to edit them.  The following section covers Network databases, which are utilized for all regular vehicle network traffic (non-diagnostic). To access the Network Databases dialog, click the Load DBC or VSDB files button.  1. Network databases  These databases are applied to all normal mode (non-diagnostic) vehicle network traffic.Clicking the Load DBC or VSDB files button will bring up the Network Databases dialog.  2. Diagnostic databases  These databases are applied to all diagnostic vehicle network traffic.Clicking the Load ODX, MDX/GDX, or A2L files button will take you to ECUs view where new diagnostic database files can be loaded.  3. MEP databases  Memory Edit Protocol reads and writes ECU memory locations using A2L database files applied to CCP or XCP vehicle network traffic.If any are missing or need updating, the Load A2L files for CCP/XCP will display a MEP view where A2L Files can be added or updated.  Extract and Export    The &quot;Extract and Export&quot; button opens a feature that can use your PC to read an SD card taken from a neoVI, extract raw data VSB files from it, then export those VSB files to other decoded file types. For neoVI working in wireless mode this extract/export process is usually done with the Wireless NeoVI website without fumbling around with SD cards  VehicleScape DAQ: Channels Tab (Select Channels to Log)  This is step 4 in making a VS3ZIP script to operate in Wireless neoVI. The VehicleScape DAQ Channels tab is where signals are selected to log. This tab is split into left and right window panes. The left side displays a list of signals to pick from and the right side allows further adjustments to the signals selected.  Left Side of Channels Tab (Figure 1)  Utilize the left-hand panel of the tab to conduct searches and designate signals from an extensive list. This compilation encompasses messages and signals sourced from databases accessible through the adjacent Database/Hardware Setup tab, as well as data from the Messages Editor and Application Signals.  Users can refine the signal list through two methods: entering text into the search field or accessing the diagnostics button to select a diagnostic category within the network/ECU tree. Additionally, users can create groups of items by employing the press-and-hold function of the CTRL or SHIFT keys while left-clicking on the desired items.  Users have the option to designate highlighted signals for logging individually or collectively. This can be achieved by selecting signals one by one or all at once, facilitated by the respective buttons located below the search field.  The Paste List button can speed up signal selection when working with a huge list of signals. First, copy to the clipboard a list of line delimited signal names from any source, like a column in a spreadsheet. Next, click the Paste List button and Vehicle Spy will attempt to select all signals that match the clipboard entries. Specific Problem Logs will indicate any signals that Vehicle Spy could not find a match for    Use the left side of VehicleScape DAQ Channels to find and select signals to log. Use the right side of the tab to make adjustments to the signals selected.  Polling Setup  These polling rates determine how fast any one shot diagnostic jobs are repeated. These polling rates do NOT affect MEP A2L file data items because those items use their own MEP DAQ Delay times.  The Set Export Order button sets the ordering of signals in CSV and MAT signal export files.  If GMLAN is enabled in Vehicle Spy Tools/Options, then items from GM cal files can be loaded by clicking a CAL File button.  Selected Channels For Test  The Selected Channels for Test area in the lower half of Figure 2 displays the signals that were selected to be logged. If the signal is a PID or MEP A2L file data item then its priority (how often it gets requested) can be changed to Fast/Medium/Slow by double clicking on it. At the bottom of this area, use the Clear button to clear the entire list or the Remove button to remove signals one at a time.    Right Click Menu (Figure 3)  The Selected Channels For Test area has an extensive right click menu with selections described below in Table 1.  Figure: The Selected Channels For Test area has useful right click menu selections.  Rt Click Menu Selection\tDescriptionPriority High/Normal/Low\tSets the periodic rate of one shot requests sent for this item.

This allows packing more items, but with a sacrifice of precision. Copy DID to ECU\tCopies a DID definition from one &quot;real&quot; ECU to another in the diagnostic database. Move DID to ECU\tAllowed only for ISO 14229 DIDs with its source being a base/virtual/GMRDB ECU with USDT request ID = 0. Use this to copy DIDs from a base/virtual/GMRDB ECU with DID definitions to &quot;real&quot; ECUs that need DID definitions in the diagnostic database. The base/virtual/GMRDB ECU DID list will remain unchanged after using this menu selection. Remove selected\tCuts selected signals from the list without copying them to the clipboard. Cut\tCuts selected signals from the list and copies their information to the clipboard Copy data\tCopies all signal information to the clipboard in a tab delimited format that can be pasted into a spreadsheet application. Paste\tPastes previously cut signals into the list. Show Diagnostic Tweaker\tShows a viewing area on the right side of the Online tab. Set Export Order\tSets the ordering of signals in CSV and MAT signal export files.  This is step 5 in making a VS3ZIP script to operate neoVI in wireless mode.  Additional help can be found in the VehicleScape DAQ Standalone Logging application note within the Vehicle Spy help files.  The Standalone Logging tab generates a script that lets ICS hardware collect data on its own while disconnected from a computer.  Standalone Logging Page Layout (Setup Standalone Logging)  The Standalone Logging page has 2 major areas and described in Table 1.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"1.5 Server Requirements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"1. Introduction and Overview","url":"/introduction-and-overview/#server-requirements","content":" CPU  CPU requirements for Wireless neoVI depend on the size and frequency of device data offloads, export options used during data processing, and whether any custom processing is implemented. As each customer’s installation has specific needs and the number of Wireless neoVI enabled devices can increase over time, determining the ideal CPU count can be challenging. However, we recommend a minimum of 6 CPU cores as a starting point.  To accommodate various environments, the number of concurrent data processing jobs in Wireless neoVI’s configurable and can be scaled accordingly. Utilizing virtualization technologies offers flexibility in scaling server performance as the fleet of devices grows.  Starting with a 6-core processor is recommended as a baseline configuration, which performs well for most installations. This setup allows for up to 4 data processing jobs to run concurrently. If there is a need to increase the number of concurrent jobs, it is advisable to increase the number of CPU cores accordingly.  RAM  On Linux hosts, the recommended minimum RAM is 16-24 GB for small to moderate fleets of devices. This amount should be scaled up as fleet sizes grow larger to ensure optimal performance and accommodate increased data processing demands.  Hard Disk  The hard disk requirements for Wireless neoVI are influenced by several factors including:  Number of logging devicesTime duration of loggingData retention periodAmount of data collected per sessionSelected data export formatsCustom processing requirements  As a starting point, we recommend allocating 1TB of data storage space. This capacity can be adjusted and scaled up as your fleet grows in size or as your data retention needs evolve.  While not required, we strongly encourage implementing a RAID configuration for disk redundancy. This helps protect against data loss in the event of a disk failure.  We advise against using NFS (Network File System) or CIFS (Common Internet File System) network shares for storing Wireless neoVI data. These network storage solutions can be unreliable due to improper configurations or high network latency, which may lead to data loss or data corruption.

This document aims to dissect the IPA components, outlining the intended usage of each component and the service as a whole.  The IPA menu includes several submenus:  Results: Displays the outcomes and outputs generated from executed Python scripts.Analyzers: Provides tools and functionalities to create, manage, and execute Python analyzers for specific data analysis tasks.Scripts: Allows users to upload, manage, and execute Python scripts for customized data processing and analysis.Data Sets: Provides access to static datasets stored in the data archive for analysis using Python scripts.Run Queue: Shows the queue of Python scripts scheduled or currently running, providing status and progress updates.How it Works: Offers an explanation and overview of the IPA service, detailing its functionality, capabilities, and integration within the Wireless neoVI platform.  Results - This shows the IPA results with search and filter option like date range. Also user can export the data in .csv and .xlsx format.    Analyzers - Analyzers are central to IPA and encompass several key components. They are designed for easy creation and editing by the user who initiates them. To create an analyzer, navigate to IPA &gt; Analyzer in the navigation bar and click the &quot;Generate&quot; button. This action prompts you to specify the components required for an Analyzer.  An Analyzer must include:  Name: A descriptive title for the analyzer.Run Type: Either &quot;Dynamic&quot; or &quot;Static&quot;, indicating whether the analysis is performed on live data as it's uploaded (&quot;Dynamic&quot;) or on pre-existing datasets (&quot;Static&quot;).Analysis Script: The Python script that defines the analysis to be performed.Dataset: The dataset(s) on which the analysis script will operate.Configurations: Optional settings that customize the behavior of the analysis.Users: Optionally, users with whom results should be automatically shared upon completion.  An analyzer can incorporate multiple analysis scripts, datasets, configurations, and users.  Once created, analyzers are listed on the Analyzer page grid. To run a static analyzer, simply click the run icon next to its entry on the grid. This action initiates a new run in the RunQueue, marked with a status of &quot;New&quot;. The IPA Scanner picks up this task, launching a container with all necessary information. The selected analysis script runs on the chosen dataset(s), and results are subsequently displayed on the Results page.  If any issues arise during processing, such as container or script errors, a DockerLog.txt file appears in the results section, containing the error details.  For dynamic datasets, activate them by clicking the green &quot;active&quot; check mark on the grid. This designation ensures that new uploads are automatically evaluated against dataset criteria. Matches trigger the designated analysis process accordingly.  You can create new Analyzers by using the button. The Analyzer page provides an overview of all analyzers, displaying details such as the Action (options to edit or delete), Name (descriptive title), Description (brief overview), Type (Dynamic or Static), Script Name (Python script used), Configuration (custom settings), Data Sets (associated datasets), Last Status (current run status), and User (creator).  Users can search for specific analyzers and apply filters as needed. The last status updates automatically based on the completion status of the most recent run.      Scripts - Analysis Scripts are the data processor assigned to an Analyzer. Users can see all Analyzer Scripts available to their organization. All users can upload Analyzer Scripts but it cannot be used by anyone until reviewed and approved by an administrator. AnalyzerScripts can be deleted by their owner and administrators. Scripts may be written in Python (R support may be added in the future). This will allow the user to add specified script to use on server.    Also the uploaded script can be reconfigure again or delete. User can export the data in .csv and .xlsx format.    After clicking on the configuration button it shows following.    Here User can download the script file, delete file and also be able to view the data in that file in json format. Inside this user can upload a new configuration file.    Configurations:  Configurations are optional for Analyzers but can be used to configure the operation of an Analysis Script based on parameters contained within.  It could be as simple as passing a parameter to make a different method in the script run or as complex as to dictate what to search for in the data.  Data Sets - Data Sets define the source data passed to your Analyzer. Data Sets can be generated either by selecting criteria, or by selecting specific files from the data query.  Files  Simply navigate to Generate page, perform a search, select your desired files and click &quot;Create DataSet&quot;. This will generate a Static Data Set which can be used for on demand Analysis.  Criteria  A dynamic Data Set is a collection of criteria in any combination or number of:  Fleets and/or VehiclesCollections and/or file namesFile extensionsDatesScripts  These Data Sets must be either Static, which are used for on demand analysis on existing files, or Dynamic, which are used for ongoing analysis of files as they are collected.  You may assign multiple Data Sets to an Analyzer so there is no need to create or maintain a single all-inclusive Data Set.  Data Sets created by you are only available to you so may add, edit, or discard them at any time.    After clicking on Add button; the search criteria will showing and in this user can select Fleets/Vehicles using check boxes, also selecting Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. User can export the data as well.    There are two types of datasets, static and dynamic, that can be used with IPA.  A Static Dataset consists of the specific files the dataset creator has chosen or via specific criteria. These datasets can be created in the data archive by selecting the files and choosing “Create Data Set”; they can also be created via the generate page. To do so, select the expected criteria, and make sure the selected type is “Static”.  Analyzing the files in a Static Dataset is a one time process done by simply selecting the Dataset for an Analyzer and clicking the “Run” icon on the Analyzers page.  A Dynamic Dataset consists of search criteria to match files against, instead of specific files. For example, when creating a Dynamic Dataset you could simply specify a vehicle, and the dataset would entail every collection associated with that vehicle, as opposed to going and selecting all the files associated with that vehicle yourself. Dynamic Data Sets at the moment can only match against future uploads.The analysis will be run on incoming collections as long as the Dataset is active. Activating the in a Dynamic Dataset is done by simply selecting the Dataset for an Analyzer and clicking the “Active” icon on the Analyzers.  Run Queue - The Run Queue is used for observing and managing existing and previous “Runs”, AKA a time when an Analyzer has tried to apply an Analysis Script(s) to Dataset(s).  Runs can be canceled by selecting the check mark associated with the row and then selecting Actions &gt; Cancel Selected. This will kill the container that is being run and end the analysis where it was taking place. Canceling will only work if the Run has a status of “NEW” or “STARTED”.  Runs can be deleted from the queue by selecting the check mark associated with the row and then selecting Actions &gt; Delete Selected. These runs will not be deleted if the status is not “NEW” or “STARTED”, you must cancel them first.  It shows the available analyzers, Job name, Result Id, Status, Created At, Started, Finished, User name and Exit Payload etc. The user is then able to export the available data in .csv format and .xlsx format.
