","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"1.5 Server Requirements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"1. Introduction and Overview","url":"/introduction-and-overview/#server-requirements","content":" CPU  CPU requirements for Wireless neoVI depend on the size and frequency of device data offloads, export options used during data processing, and whether any custom processing is implemented. As each customer’s installation has specific needs and the number of Wireless neoVI enabled devices can increase over time, determining the ideal CPU count can be challenging. However, we recommend a minimum of 6 CPU cores as a starting point.  To accommodate various environments, the number of concurrent data processing jobs in Wireless neoVI’s configurable and can be scaled accordingly. Utilizing virtualization technologies offers flexibility in scaling server performance as the fleet of devices grows.  Starting with a 6-core processor is recommended as a baseline configuration, which performs well for most installations. This setup allows for up to 4 data processing jobs to run concurrently. If there is a need to increase the number of concurrent jobs, it is advisable to increase the number of CPU cores accordingly.  RAM  On Linux hosts, the recommended minimum RAM is 16-24 GB for small to moderate fleets of devices. This amount should be scaled up as fleet sizes grow larger to ensure optimal performance and accommodate increased data processing demands.  Hard Disk  The hard disk requirements for Wireless neoVI are influenced by several factors including:  Number of logging devicesTime duration of loggingData retention periodAmount of data collected per sessionSelected data export formatsCustom processing requirements  As a starting point, we recommend allocating 1TB of data storage space. This capacity can be adjusted and scaled up as your fleet grows in size or as your data retention needs evolve.  While not required, we strongly encourage implementing a RAID configuration for disk redundancy. This helps protect against data loss in the event of a disk failure.  We advise against using NFS (Network File System) or CIFS (Common Internet File System) network shares for storing Wireless neoVI data. These network storage solutions can be unreliable due to improper configurations or high network latency, which may lead to data loss or data corruption.

This document aims to dissect the IPA components, outlining the intended usage of each component and the service as a whole.  The IPA menu includes several submenus:  Results: Displays the outcomes and outputs generated from executed Python scripts.Analyzers: Provides tools and functionalities to create, manage, and execute Python analyzers for specific data analysis tasks.Scripts: Allows users to upload, manage, and execute Python scripts for customized data processing and analysis.Data Sets: Provides access to static datasets stored in the data archive for analysis using Python scripts.Run Queue: Shows the queue of Python scripts scheduled or currently running, providing status and progress updates.How it Works: Offers an explanation and overview of the IPA service, detailing its functionality, capabilities, and integration within the Wireless neoVI platform.  Results - This shows the IPA results with search and filter option like date range. Also user can export the data in .csv and .xlsx format.    Analyzers - Analyzers are central to IPA and encompass several key components. They are designed for easy creation and editing by the user who initiates them. To create an analyzer, navigate to IPA &gt; Analyzer in the navigation bar and click the &quot;Generate&quot; button. This action prompts you to specify the components required for an Analyzer.  An Analyzer must include:  Name: A descriptive title for the analyzer.Run Type: Either &quot;Dynamic&quot; or &quot;Static&quot;, indicating whether the analysis is performed on live data as it's uploaded (&quot;Dynamic&quot;) or on pre-existing datasets (&quot;Static&quot;).Analysis Script: The Python script that defines the analysis to be performed.Dataset: The dataset(s) on which the analysis script will operate.Configurations: Optional settings that customize the behavior of the analysis.Users: Optionally, users with whom results should be automatically shared upon completion.  An analyzer can incorporate multiple analysis scripts, datasets, configurations, and users.  Once created, analyzers are listed on the Analyzer page grid. To run a static analyzer, simply click the run icon next to its entry on the grid. This action initiates a new run in the RunQueue, marked with a status of &quot;New&quot;. The IPA Scanner picks up this task, launching a container with all necessary information. The selected analysis script runs on the chosen dataset(s), and results are subsequently displayed on the Results page.  If any issues arise during processing, such as container or script errors, a DockerLog.txt file appears in the results section, containing the error details.  For dynamic datasets, activate them by clicking the green &quot;active&quot; check mark on the grid. This designation ensures that new uploads are automatically evaluated against dataset criteria. Matches trigger the designated analysis process accordingly.  You can create new Analyzers by using the button. The Analyzer page provides an overview of all analyzers, displaying details such as the Action (options to edit or delete), Name (descriptive title), Description (brief overview), Type (Dynamic or Static), Script Name (Python script used), Configuration (custom settings), Data Sets (associated datasets), Last Status (current run status), and User (creator).  Users can search for specific analyzers and apply filters as needed. The last status updates automatically based on the completion status of the most recent run.      Scripts - Analysis Scripts are the data processor assigned to an Analyzer. Users can see all Analyzer Scripts available to their organization. All users can upload Analyzer Scripts but it cannot be used by anyone until reviewed and approved by an administrator. AnalyzerScripts can be deleted by their owner and administrators. Scripts may be written in Python (R support may be added in the future). This will allow the user to add specified script to use on server.    Also the uploaded script can be reconfigure again or delete. User can export the data in .csv and .xlsx format.    After clicking on the configuration button it shows following.    Here User can download the script file, delete file and also be able to view the data in that file in json format. Inside this user can upload a new configuration file.    Configurations:  Configurations are optional for Analyzers but can be used to configure the operation of an Analysis Script based on parameters contained within.  It could be as simple as passing a parameter to make a different method in the script run or as complex as to dictate what to search for in the data.  Data Sets - Data Sets define the source data passed to your Analyzer. Data Sets can be generated either by selecting criteria, or by selecting specific files from the data query.  Files  Simply navigate to Generate page, perform a search, select your desired files and click &quot;Create DataSet&quot;. This will generate a Static Data Set which can be used for on demand Analysis.  Criteria  A dynamic Data Set is a collection of criteria in any combination or number of:  Fleets and/or VehiclesCollections and/or file namesFile extensionsDatesScripts  These Data Sets must be either Static, which are used for on demand analysis on existing files, or Dynamic, which are used for ongoing analysis of files as they are collected.  You may assign multiple Data Sets to an Analyzer so there is no need to create or maintain a single all-inclusive Data Set.  Data Sets created by you are only available to you so may add, edit, or discard them at any time.    After clicking on Add button; the search criteria will showing and in this user can select Fleets/Vehicles using check boxes, also selecting Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. User can export the data as well.    There are two types of datasets, static and dynamic, that can be used with IPA.  A Static Dataset consists of the specific files the dataset creator has chosen or via specific criteria. These datasets can be created in the data archive by selecting the files and choosing “Create Data Set”; they can also be created via the generate page. To do so, select the expected criteria, and make sure the selected type is “Static”.  Analyzing the files in a Static Dataset is a one time process done by simply selecting the Dataset for an Analyzer and clicking the “Run” icon on the Analyzers page.  A Dynamic Dataset consists of search criteria to match files against, instead of specific files. For example, when creating a Dynamic Dataset you could simply specify a vehicle, and the dataset would entail every collection associated with that vehicle, as opposed to going and selecting all the files associated with that vehicle yourself. Dynamic Data Sets at the moment can only match against future uploads.The analysis will be run on incoming collections as long as the Dataset is active. Activating the in a Dynamic Dataset is done by simply selecting the Dataset for an Analyzer and clicking the “Active” icon on the Analyzers.  Run Queue - The Run Queue is used for observing and managing existing and previous “Runs”, AKA a time when an Analyzer has tried to apply an Analysis Script(s) to Dataset(s).  Runs can be canceled by selecting the check mark associated with the row and then selecting Actions &gt; Cancel Selected. This will kill the container that is being run and end the analysis where it was taking place. Canceling will only work if the Run has a status of “NEW” or “STARTED”.  Runs can be deleted from the queue by selecting the check mark associated with the row and then selecting Actions &gt; Delete Selected. These runs will not be deleted if the status is not “NEW” or “STARTED”, you must cancel them first.

Diagnostic databases  These databases are applied to all diagnostic vehicle network traffic.Clicking the Load ODX, MDX/GDX, or A2L files button will take you to ECUs view where new diagnostic database files can be loaded.  3. MEP databases  Memory Edit Protocol reads and writes ECU memory locations using A2L database files applied to CCP or XCP vehicle network traffic.If any are missing or need updating, the Load A2L files for CCP/XCP will display a MEP view where A2L Files can be added or updated.  Extract and Export    The &quot;Extract and Export&quot; button opens a feature that can use your PC to read an SD card taken from a neoVI, extract raw data VSB files from it, then export those VSB files to other decoded file types. For neoVI working in wireless mode this extract/export process is usually done with the Wireless NeoVI website without fumbling around with SD cards  VehicleScape DAQ: Channels Tab (Select Channels to Log)  This is step 4 in making a VS3ZIP script to operate in Wireless neoVI. The VehicleScape DAQ Channels tab is where signals are selected to log. This tab is split into left and right window panes. The left side displays a list of signals to pick from and the right side allows further adjustments to the signals selected.  Left Side of Channels Tab (Figure 1)  Utilize the left-hand panel of the tab to conduct searches and designate signals from an extensive list. This compilation encompasses messages and signals sourced from databases accessible through the adjacent Database/Hardware Setup tab, as well as data from the Messages Editor and Application Signals.  Users can refine the signal list through two methods: entering text into the search field or accessing the diagnostics button to select a diagnostic category within the network/ECU tree. Additionally, users can create groups of items by employing the press-and-hold function of the CTRL or SHIFT keys while left-clicking on the desired items.  Users have the option to designate highlighted signals for logging individually or collectively. This can be achieved by selecting signals one by one or all at once, facilitated by the respective buttons located below the search field.  The Paste List button can speed up signal selection when working with a huge list of signals. First, copy to the clipboard a list of line delimited signal names from any source, like a column in a spreadsheet. Next, click the Paste List button and Vehicle Spy will attempt to select all signals that match the clipboard entries. Specific Problem Logs will indicate any signals that Vehicle Spy could not find a match for    Use the left side of VehicleScape DAQ Channels to find and select signals to log. Use the right side of the tab to make adjustments to the signals selected.  Polling Setup  These polling rates determine how fast any one shot diagnostic jobs are repeated. These polling rates do NOT affect MEP A2L file data items because those items use their own MEP DAQ Delay times.  The Set Export Order button sets the ordering of signals in CSV and MAT signal export files.  If GMLAN is enabled in Vehicle Spy Tools/Options, then items from GM cal files can be loaded by clicking a CAL File button.  Selected Channels For Test  The Selected Channels for Test area in the lower half of Figure 2 displays the signals that were selected to be logged. If the signal is a PID or MEP A2L file data item then its priority (how often it gets requested) can be changed to Fast/Medium/Slow by double clicking on it. At the bottom of this area, use the Clear button to clear the entire list or the Remove button to remove signals one at a time.    Right Click Menu (Figure 3)  The Selected Channels For Test area has an extensive right click menu with selections described below in Table 1.  Figure: The Selected Channels For Test area has useful right click menu selections.  Rt Click Menu Selection\tDescriptionPriority High/Normal/Low\tSets the periodic rate of one shot requests sent for this item.

This allows packing more items, but with a sacrifice of precision. Copy DID to ECU\tCopies a DID definition from one &quot;real&quot; ECU to another in the diagnostic database. Move DID to ECU\tAllowed only for ISO 14229 DIDs with its source being a base/virtual/GMRDB ECU with USDT request ID = 0. Use this to copy DIDs from a base/virtual/GMRDB ECU with DID definitions to &quot;real&quot; ECUs that need DID definitions in the diagnostic database. The base/virtual/GMRDB ECU DID list will remain unchanged after using this menu selection. Remove selected\tCuts selected signals from the list without copying them to the clipboard.

Figure: The Standalone Logging Reporting Options.  Standalone Logging Power Management  In VehicleScape DAQ the Standalone Logging feature has important Power Management settings to control when the logger will go to sleep and wake up. These power mode settings apply to all Standalone Logging collections.  All neoVI loggers (neoVI Connect/RED2/FIRE3/ION) are designed to be &quot;always on&quot;, which means they do not have power on/off switches. Various sleep and wake up settings are available to minimize power consumption while connected to power. The default sleep setting in VehicleScape DAQ is set to sleep after 120 seconds of no bus activity. Avoid the “Never Sleep” setting when plugging the neoVI logger into a car to avoid killing the car battery!  Refer to Table 1 which describes the settings in Figure 1.  Table 1: Standalone Logging Power Management Settings  Power Management Setting\tDescription Disable all logger Tx'ing on this\tFor all collections, stop all transmit messages sent by the logger after the chosen expression becomes true. Never\tFor all collections, use default firmware settings configured in hardware with neoVI Explorer. The firmware default for all ICS hardware is Sleep Mode DISABLED, which means never enter sleep mode...always stay awake. This setting can kill a car battery if used incorrectly. When Message Not Present\tFor all collections, go to sleep after a chosen message is not received for a chosen period of time. On Expression\tFor all collections, go to sleep after a chosen expression is true for a chosen period of time. On No Bus Activity\tFor all collections, go to sleep after all chosen networks connected to the logger remain quiet for a chosen period of time. Networks are chosen by clicking Advanced Options in the Standalone Logging Generate section. Time Period\tFor all collections, the length of time to wait (in seconds) before going to sleep. Normal Wakeup\tFor all collections: When awake, everything runs.When asleep, the wakeup might not log the first few messages. This mode has the lowest current draw while asleep when compared to Instant and Drowsy modes. Any activity on any network connected to the logger will trigger a wakeup and keep it awake until sleep conditions are met again. Instant (HS/MS) Wakeup\tFor all collections: When awake, everything runs. When asleep, a wakeup from HS or MSCAN can log the first message that woke it up. This mode has higher current draw while asleep when compared to Normal mode. Any activity on any network connected to the logger will trigger a wakeup and keep it awake until sleep conditions are met again. Drowsy Wakeup\tFor all collections: (intended for neoVI) When awake, the touch screen remains off, but the script and SD card still run.When asleep, a wakeup from HS or MSCAN can log the first message that woke it up. For neoVI PLASMA, this mode has the lowest current draw while AWAKE when compared to Normal and Instant modes. Any activity on any network connected to the logger will trigger a wakeup and keep it awake until sleep conditions are met again. Start a new file when waking up\tFor all collections, start a new log file after each wakeup instead of appending data to a previous log file. neoVI remote wakeup\tFor all collections, allow a sleeping to be woken up with an SMS text message. 3G\tUse the 3G wireless link to upload all log files to a WirelessNeoVI server before going to sleep. (slower than WIFI, but usually more available in the USA) WIFI\tUse the PLASMA WIFI wireless link to upload all log files to a WirelessNeoVI server before going to sleep. (faster than 3G, but not as widely available in the USA) Fail Timeout\tFor all collections, PLASMA will automatically upload all log files to a WirelessNeoVI server before going to sleep until it is successful or until this timeout (in minutes) expires. This timer is reset after each PLASMA wakeup.

Power Modes  Always On  The neoVI RED2/FIRE3 are designed to be &quot;always on&quot; until its power connection is removed. Various sleep and wake up settings are available to minimize power consumption.  Power Up Sequence (Table 1)  Connecting power first to neoVI RED2/FIRE3 always starts its VS3ZIP script (if present). Connecting USB to PC first will prevent the VS3ZIP script from starting on its own.  Table 1: Results of neoVI PLASMA Power Up Sequence  Power Up Sequence\tResult\tLED Blink Pattern (neoVI) Power Only\tVS3ZIP script starts* (if present)\tBlink Red Only (LED #1) Power then USB\tPower 1st - VS3ZIP script starts* (if present) USB 2nd - neoVI PLASMA can be used with the PC, even after the script has started\tAlternate Red / Green (LED #1 / #2) USB then Power\tUSB 1st - neoVI PLASMA can be used with the PC Power 2nd - VS3ZIP script does NOT start*\tBlink Green Only (LED #2)  * REMEMBER: The Wireless NeoVI website can also start, stop, clear and change VS3ZIP scripts in neoVI PLASMA from far away! So when using neoVI PLASMA with a PC, it is sometimes necessary to disable the Wireless neoVI application to clearly establish control over the device.  Power Management Using Standalone Logging Settings  When making a VS3ZIP script file using Vehicle Spy VehicleScape DAQ, the Standalone Logging Power Management options in Figure 1 offer great flexibility.  Figure: The Power Management area on the VehicleScape DAQ, Standalone Logging tab.  Sleep Triggers - There are four selections to choose from, with the last three having an adjustable timer setting.  Never - never sleep. This option can kill a car battery if not used correctly.When Message Not Present - sleep after specific message is not on the networkOn Expression - sleep after an expression is trueOn No Bus Activity - sleep after the network(s) remain quiet  &quot;Wake Up&quot; Modes - These are not really wake up modes because these are actually three power modes that affect how neoVI operates when awake OR asleep.  These modes are summarized in Table 2.  #\tMode\tWhen Awake\tWhen Asleep\tAwake mA @ 12V\tAsleep mA @ 12V 0\tNormal\tEverything runs.\tWakeup might miss first few messages.\t~ 700 mA\t~ 10 mA 2\tInstant (HS/MS)\tEverything runs.\tWakeup from HS or MSCAN will log first message.\t~ 700 mA\t~ 44 mA 7\tDrowsy\tScreen remains off, but script and SD card runs.\tWakeup from HS or MSCAN will log first message.\t~ 180 mA\t~ 44 mA  The # column in Table 2 is the value of the &quot;Power Management Mode&quot; signal found in the Vehicle Spy Expression Builder under the Physical IO, Power Management category.
